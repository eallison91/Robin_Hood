TONIGHT (Tuesday):
Nora:
- Get to the point where individual arrows (incl graphics) and projectiles can fly through their entire trajectory
- Implement timer in ProjectileController that launches boulders periodically
- Put together a simple level 1 stage that can actually run


Jake:
- Create (in an independent project, if necessary, for compilation issues) a bow that can render in 2 positions (stretched and unstretched) in response to clicking and dragging
- Start designing layout components for "StartMenuState" (name, start button, maybe that's it?)
